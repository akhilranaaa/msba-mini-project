# HireWheels

Simple monolithic Backend API for a car rental application developed in Spring Boot 🕶️☕

Features of the Project 🔌

  Types of users ➡️
    
    Each user registered on the application can have either of the following two roles:

      USER:
        Users with this role are regular customers who wish to book a vehicle from the application.
      
      ADMIN: 
        Users with this role serve as administrators for the application.
        Admins can add new vehicles to the application.
        Admins can change the availability of registered vehicles.

  Login ➡️

    This feature would allow users to log in to the application to continue ahead with vehicle booking.
  
  Signup ➡️

    This feature would allow users to register themselves on the web application. 
    Users must register themselves on the application if they wish to book vehicles.

  Vehicle Booking 🛑

    This feature would allow users to book vehicles according to their requirements.
  
  Vehicle Registration ➡️

    This feature would allow users with the ‘ADMIN’ role to add vehicles to the portal.
    While registering vehicles, the Admin maps each vehicle to a location. 
    This means that a particular vehicle will only be available for a pickup location.
  
Change Vehicle Availability 

    This feature would allow users with the ‘ADMIN’ role to change the availability of vehicles.
    For example, the Admin can make a registered vehicle unavailable for booking.
    
Note: Not all features are implemented yet
